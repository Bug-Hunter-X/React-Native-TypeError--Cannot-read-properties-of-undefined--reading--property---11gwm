This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined. This often happens when you're working with asynchronous data or when you're not properly handling potential errors in your data fetching.  For instance, if your component receives data from an API call and the API call fails, the data might be null, leading to a TypeError when the component tries to render the data.
