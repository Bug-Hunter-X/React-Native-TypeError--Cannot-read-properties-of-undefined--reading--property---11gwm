## React Native TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')

This repository demonstrates a common TypeError in React Native applications and provides a solution. The error, "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')", arises when attempting to access a property of an object that is currently undefined or null. This is frequently encountered when dealing with asynchronous data fetching, where the data might not be available immediately.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a robust solution using optional chaining and nullish coalescing to handle potential null or undefined values gracefully.  The solution ensures that the application handles these scenarios without crashing.
